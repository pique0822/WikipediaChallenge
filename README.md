# WikipediaChallenge
The Wikipedia Challenge! A way to test your common knowledge and ability to search through Wikipedia in record time!
Originally designed to be a Google Chrome extension, it is fully functional and available for anyone to use!
It currently is unavailable in the Google Chrome store due to my lack of Google Developer License but will be up soon!

#How to Play
Enter the start and finish locations into the textboxes and hit begin! Try to go from one end of Wikipedia to another! Use the metrics
to race our friends and see who can find a path in the least amount of time or in the least amount of clicks!

#How to Install
1. You must have Google Chrome installed.
2. Download this repository fully and place it somewhere easily accesible for you to find later.
3. Type chrome://extensions in your URL.
4. Click on the 'Developer Mode' checkbox.
5. Click on 'Load unpacked extension' and find the folder that leads to the Wikipedia Challenge

At this point you should see a little W in a dark gray border on the side of the URL! Just click it once and enjoy!
